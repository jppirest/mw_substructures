# B.Sc Project - Milky Way Substructures

This is a repository where I put all my undegraduate work on stellar populations.

Yet to organize the folders and sections.

The GAIA section is where I spent most of my undergrad time in. There, I studied unsupervised algorithms to correctly identify and characterize star clusters.

I developed an automatic isochrone fitting algorithm, based on minimizing the $\chi^2$  between the curve and the data. It is parallelized and CPU-bound. I still have to optimize it and make the parellelism robust.
